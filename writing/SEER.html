<p><i>The future is data.</i></p>
<p>All Maria has to do is think about a simple task, like turning on the lights, and it happens. It's not magic, it's SEER, the government-operated algorithm that makes life in the 22nd century so idyllic. By harvesting massive amounts of personal data, SEER can predict what a person will want the moment they want it.</p>
<p>It’s only when she’s kidnapped by a group of anti-SEER rebels that Maria learns there’s more to the algorithm than she knew. SEER is not just making people's lives easier; it’s being used by those in power to control the public and stamp out potential opposition. At least, that’s what Vincent, the leader of the rebel group, tells her.</p>
<p>Vincent needs Maria’s cybersecurity expertise to take SEER down. But can she trust him? If he’s telling the truth, bringing down SEER could free the country from its oppressive control. Or it could be an act of horrific domestic terrorism, plunging the country into chaos.</p>
<p>No matter what she chooses, associating with the rebels has already made Maria the target of an army of autonomous combat drones. An army that can predict what she'll do before the thought even crosses her mind. Surrounded by danger and deception, Maria’s resolve will be tested if she hopes to prevent catastrophe, let alone survive.</p>
