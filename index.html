		<p>What makes you human? As the first person in the world to have her mind copied to a machine, Lisa may soon learn the answer. Her copyâ€™s mechanical body is stronger and more durable than bone, flesh, and blood could ever be. But the dream of roboticists and neuroscientists everywhere may turn out to be a nightmare.</p>
