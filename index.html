		<p>The future is data.</p>
		<p>You know yourself best. This has been true throughout history. Until SEER proved it dead wrong. In the 22nd century, every moment of a person&#39;s life is digitized, and the government-run algorithm instantly provides for every need.</p>
		<p>Maria&#39;s only desire is one the algorithm is unable to satisfy: for her sister Ana to have never committed suicide.</p>
		<p>When Maria is kidnapped by a group of rebels she discovers that it was SEER, not suicide, that killed Ana. Her kidnappers believe SEER can predict every thought, and that it uses that information to manipulate public opinion to suit the interests of SEER&#39;s masters. If anyone resists they end up like Ana.</p>
		<p>Maria&#39;s expertise in cybersecurity makes her one of the few with the skills to fight back against SEER. She joins the team of rebels, vowing to keep what happened to Ana from ever happening again. Which means she has to infiltrate the most secure facility in the country and fight through armies of autonomous drones. But every step toward SEER&#39;s control terminal brings a growing fear that she is handing a dangerous power over to someone even worse.</p>
