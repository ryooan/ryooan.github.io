It seems to me like the information on the potential coronavirus vaccines has been fairly scattered and disorganized. The important information never seems like it's all presented together in one place. So I thought I'd take a shot at providing a more useful resource. The table below has the latest information I could find on the vaccines the US has agreed to purchase. Sources and notes are below the table with more information. The embedded table is a bit hard to navigate so [for better viewing in a full screen mode go to this link.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRv1dkfnXoJ0qQ_EVlLBaMnoezi5kvH9NdqaHC1o7c7T48t92xmvNjlvOATnISwUzrEHagOGHUQyU4C/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true) I'll be updating this table occasionally, check the date below the table for when it was last updated.
