Trying to get information on the potential coronavirus vaccines has been frustrating. The information I want is never in one place, it's often vague and usually scattered across multiple links. So I thought I'd take a shot ðŸ’‰ at providing a more useful resource. The table below has the latest information I could find on the vaccines the US has agreed to purchase. Sources and notes are below the table with more information. The embedded table is a bit hard to navigate so [for better full-screen viewing go to this link.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRv1dkfnXoJ0qQ_EVlLBaMnoezi5kvH9NdqaHC1o7c7T48t92xmvNjlvOATnISwUzrEHagOGHUQyU4C/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true) I'll be updating this table occasionally, check the date below the table for when it was last updated.
