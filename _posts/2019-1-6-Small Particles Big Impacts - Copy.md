I don't understand how people can think that CO2 can't possibly be causing global warming just because it makes up a small part of the atmosphere. You know how you can taste chlorine in drinking water sometimes? Chlorine concentrations in tap water are normally around 1 part per million (ppm). At 3 or 4 ppm the taste of chlorine in the water becomes disgustingly strong. We're at around 406 ppm of CO2 in the atmosphere, over 100 ppm higher than at any point in the last 800,000 years. Obviously you can't compare the ppm of two different molecules, but the idea that CO2 can't be responsible for climate change because it's a small component of the atmosphere is absurd.
