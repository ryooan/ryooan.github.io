I'm listening to I, Robot by Isaac Asimov and its great so far, but it's pretty funny how his imagined future still has people using a lot of paper and cigarettes and treating women as weak/inferior. What kinds of things do we take for granted today that will probably not be normal in the future, or what kinds of things do you see in shows and books about the future that probably won't actually be around?
