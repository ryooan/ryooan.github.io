If you believe in free markets then you believe in creative destruction, the loss of businesses that lose out to better businesses. That means constant job loss and it means some regions and areas may struggle. To make a free market as efficient as possible, we need strong welfare benefits so that workers have the resources to get back into the workforce.

If you believe in providing strong welfare benefits to the poor so they can make it out of poverty and improve their lives then you should also be in favor of the best method we have to generate wealth: free markets. Free markets that are regulated so as not to impose unpaid costs on society improve quality of life for our citizens and are in a large part responsible for the wealth that makes being poor in America better than being poor in a third world country. A wealthier country can provide more for its poorest through government as well as through markets.

The two go hand in hand.
