				<p>I don’t understand how people can think that CO2 can’t possibly be causing global warming just because it makes up a small part of the atmosphere. You know how you can taste chlorine in drinking water sometimes? Chlorine concentrations in tap water are normally around 1 part per million (ppm). At 3 or 4 ppm the taste of chlorine in the water becomes disgustingly strong. We’re at around 406 ppm of CO2 in the atmosphere, over 100 ppm higher than at any point in the last 800,000 years. Obviously you can’t compare the ppm of two different molecules, but the idea that CO2 can’t be responsible for climate change because it’s a small component of the atmosphere is absurd.</p>

				<p>06 Jan 2019</p>

				<p>I’m listening to I, Robot by Isaac Asimov and its great so far, but it’s pretty funny how his imagined future still has people using a lot of paper and cigarettes and treating women as weak/inferior. What kinds of things do we take for granted today that will probably not be normal in the future, or what kinds of things do you see in shows and books about the future that probably won’t actually be around?</p>

				<p>06 Jan 2019</p>

				<p>If you believe in free markets then you believe in creative destruction, the loss of businesses that lose out to better businesses. That means constant job loss and it means some regions and areas may struggle. To make a free market as efficient as possible, we need strong welfare benefits so that workers have the resources to get back into the workforce.</p>

<p>If you believe in providing strong welfare benefits to the poor so they can make it out of poverty and improve their lives then you should also be in favor of the best method we have to generate wealth: free markets. Free markets that are regulated so as not to impose unpaid costs on society improve quality of life for our citizens and are in a large part responsible for the wealth that makes being poor in America better than being poor in a third world country. A wealthier country can provide more for its poorest through government as well as through markets.</p>

<p>The two go hand in hand.</p>
