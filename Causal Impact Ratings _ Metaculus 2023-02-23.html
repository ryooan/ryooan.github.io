If a ZEV with the performance characteristics that US consumers consider acceptable retains a large subsidy-adjusted purchase price premium relative to a comparable ICE vehicle, I expect that to have a very significant negative impact on ZEV purchases, as less affluent consumers will be hard-pressed to make the transition even if they are eager to do so. A minor increase in the cost of raw materials, on the order of 8%, would probably be offset by battery technology improvements such that it would not significantly affect affordability; but larger increases, on the order of 70%, would probably mean ZEV purchase prices are still substantially higher than those of ICE vehicles. </p>\n<p>Public charging stations, rating: 77.5</p>\n<p>I think this is the second most important indicator among those we have considered, and I assign it relatively high causal significance because I think that if the number of charging stations in existence in the near term is towards the higher end of our expectations, it means that certain barriers (like permitting, or protectionist sourcing requirements) to construction have probably been somewhat remediated; or that they were less of an impediment than had been expected. If these potential problems have been addressed or overcome rapidly, the charging availability anxiety problem likely becomes a less significant impediment to ZEV purchases on a shorter timescale.

If relatively affordable mass-market EVs have achieved a median range well in excess of that as early as 2025, the range anxiety problem should be largely overcome, which I would expect to have a significant positive effect on EV sales. I would rate this as more significant if the 25th percentile value were significantly further from that 300 mile target, but 272 isn't too far off, so I consider this indicator a bit less significant than charging availability, given the larger difference between the 25th and 75th percentiles there.</p>\n<p>Gasoline price, rating: 70</p>\n<p>I rate this as a highly significant indicator on the basis that I expect uncomfortably high gas prices, especially if sustained, and if consumers <em>expect</em> them to be sustained, to be a major factor that causes consumers to consider purchasing ZEVs - but I don't rate it as more significant than those mentioned above because I think the anxieties that consumers have about suitability (range, charging availability) and purchase affordability are significant enough that even if gas prices are uncomfortably high, they would be (if not addressed) significant barriers to ZEV purchase.</p>\n<p><strong>Indicators of moderate significance</strong></p>\n<p>US ZEV sales share (2026), rating: 65</p>\n<p>I consider this moderately important in that it indicates higher enthusiasm than expected for ZEV purchases; however, I don't assign it a higher rating because I think this indicator is downstream of those mentioned above.

A significant matter of uncertainty here is how stable these mandates would be; the fact that they are in place in 2025 would not necessarily mean that they will remain in force unaltered through 2030. Uncertainty around regulatory stability causes me not to rate this as more significant. Another factor is that the extent to which it is politically feasible to enact a ZEV mandate is itself a result of other outcomes, like ZEV affordability, consumer satisfaction with ZEVs on the market, and consumer confidence in available charging infrastructure. As I think states likely need those to be trending in the right direction if they are to enact ZEV mandates, I think the existence of the mandates themselves is more a result of other factors than a major causal factor in itself.</p>\n<p>ZEV models in US under $40k, rating: 60</p>\n<p>I consider this a moderately important indicator because greater consumer choice in the ZEV marketplace would generally be expected to have a positive effect on the ZEV sales share; however, I don't rate this as more significant because there is significant uncertainty around the performance characteristics of vehicles in this segment of the market. If a significant fraction of vehicles in this segment have performance characteristics that do not satisfy many consumers, a large number of low-selling models may not have a particularly significant effect on the ZEV sales share. To the extent that it may be the case that there are many models of high-selling ZEVs under $40k, I think that would mainly be the result of success in achieving a stable supply of reasonably priced raw materials, so I do not rate this indicator as highly significant, as it is largely the result of successful policy elsewhere. </p>\n<p><strong>Indicators of least significance</strong></p>\n<p>California ZEV sales share, rating: 55</p>\n<p>I rate this as one of the less significant indicators because I think the Californian economy, consumer, and regulatory environment are unrepresentative of the US in general, and likely to remain that way for the foreseeable future. However, California is one of the larger vehicle marketplaces in the US, and as such I think a higher ZEV sales share earlier in California could still be indicative of a faster than expected transition nationally.

In general, I think the vast majority of consumers are much more concerned with factors like affordability and performance than emissions. However, if emissions are somewhat higher than expected, this group of consumers highly concerned about emissions may become larger. The political situation is relatively unclear, in that if emissions are higher than expected, it seems likely to have been a result of policy failures or changes in policy that have de-emphasized or diminished the ZEV transition.

Government might care more, but I don't see them acting drastically differently with a ~10% counterfactual difference in emissions.\n\n|Indicator                               | Causal Impact |\n|----------------------------------------|---------------|\n|EV median range under $40k              | 70            |\n|Public charging stations                | 70            |\n|US ZEV sales share [2026]               | 70            |\n|Electricity price                       | 45            |\n|ZEV tax credits claimed                 | 55            |\n|Global ZEV sales share                  | 65            |\n|States adopting ZEV mandates            | 60            |\n|ZEV federal fleet procurements          | 50            |\n|Gasoline price                          | 75            |\n|Change in energy transition metal index | 25            |\n|ZEV models in US under $40k             | 65            |\n|California ZEV sales share              | 55            |\n|Fuel economy regulations                | 52            |\n|EV industry employment                  | 55            |\n|CO2 emissions in the US                 | 52            |","created_time":"2023-02-22T14:11:36.204918Z","prediction_value":null,"submit_type":"S","num_likes":2,"parent":null,"num_children":0,"deleted":false,"parent_author":null,"user_like":null,"latest_prediction":null,"edits":[]},{"url":"https://www.metaculus.com/api2/comments/116367/","id":116367,"author":133407,"author_name":"Pro D","author_lvl":1,"author_supporter_lvl":0,"is_moderator":false,"is_admin":false,"question":{"id":15180,"title":"[Pro Forecasting] How causally impactful would the listed indicator be depending on 25th or 75th percentile resolution?","url":"/questions/15180/causal-impact-ratings/","possibilities":{}},"comment_html":"<p>I will use this likert chart as a reference for my forecasts:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Value</th>\n<th>Meaning</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>extremely negative impact</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>very negative impact</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>30</td>\n<td>fairly negative impact</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>40</td>\n<td>slight negative impact</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>50</td>\n<td>no causal impact</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>60</td>\n<td>slight positive impact</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>70</td>\n<td>fairly positive impact</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>80</td>\n<td>very positive impact</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>90</td>\n<td>extremely positive impact</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Here are my values:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Variable</th>\n<th>Causal Rating</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>EV median range under $40k</td>\n<td>65</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Public charging stations</td>\n<td>65</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>US ZEV sales share [2026]*</td>\n<td>60</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Electricity price</td>\n<td>45</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ZEV tax credits claimed</td>\n<td>50</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Global ZEV sales share</td>\n<td>60</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>States adopting ZEV mandates</td>\n<td>60</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ZEV federal fleet procurements</td>\n<td>50</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gasoline price</td>\n<td>75</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Change in energy transition metal index</td>\n<td>25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ZEV models in US under $40k</td>\n<td>55</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>California ZEV sales share</td>\n<td>55</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fuel economy regulations</td>\n<td>55</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>EV industry employment</td>\n<td>50</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CO2 emissions in the US</td>\n<td>55</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>I'll go over each one:</p>\n<p>EV median range under $40k: I figure median range could have a big effect on how quickly ZEV adoption takes hold in America. That said, median range will probably be most important for non-light ZEVs such as trucks where they are frequently driving long distances.</p>\n<p>Public charging stations: I figure that the amount of charging stations will play an important role in ZEV sales, but it's hard for me to know how much of an effect 165k vs. 85k charging stations would play because I am unsure what number of charging stations will be enough where it is no longer a pain to find a charging station if you have a ZEV.</p>\n<p>US ZEV sales share [2026]*: This would have a huge effect on my forecast for 2030 sales because it is signaling how quickly ZEV adoption is taking place, but I am not giving it a higher number because I think there are other causal factors that are creating 2026 sales and 2030 sales to be a certain way, so the direct causality from the 2026 sales share is perhaps more humble.</p>\n<p>Electricity price: This would have a much bigger effect if there was a large enough difference between the 25th and 75th percentile, but the difference between them is miniscule.</p>\n<p>ZEV tax credits claimed: It's hard to know how this will affect sales because more tax credits claimed might mean the government is closer to winding down this tax credit program because it feels like the program has already done what it was meant to do, or it could also mean that the government wants to continue this tax credit program because it believes the program is a success. I'm not sure which thing will have a stronger effect, so I'm staying neutral for now with this one.</p>\n<p>Global ZEV sales share: If global ZEV sales are quite a bit higher, that could create downward pressure on prices as car companies are able to lower costs as a result of economies of scale.</p>\n<p>States adopting ZEV mandates: This could have a huge impact if the difference between the 25th and 75th percentile was bigger, but the group of states that would potentially qualify as the 16 states adopting this mandate will probably have large uptake regardless of whether there are mandates in place.</p>\n<p>ZEV federal fleet procurements: I don't see there being much causality because there could be different parties in power in the two years we are looking at (2025 and 2030), so the one party could easily do exactly the opposite of what the other one did (unless cost savings were so significant that Republicans were much more open to having ZEVs for federal vehicles, but this would be caused by another variable: cheaper prices, so there is still not much causality between ZEV federal fleet procurement in 2025 and ZEV market share in 2030).</p>\n<p>Gasoline price: I think this is one of the main inputs for how high ZEV market share will be in 2030. The price difference between the 25th and 75th percentile is big enough that I think there would be a fairly large impact in the difference between these two scenarios.</p>\n<p>Change in energy transition metal index: This is also another input that I think will have a big effect, especially considering there is a large difference between the 25th and 75th percentiles. If ZEVs are much more expensive, there will be significantly less adoption.</p>\n<p>ZEV models in US under $40k: I'm not sure how much 27 models cheaper than 40k vs. 15 models cheaper than 40k would make a difference. As long as there are enough models (15 seems plenty) where consumers feel they have enough of a choice to find one that is right for them, this doesn't seem like it should have a huge effect.</p>\n<p>California ZEV sales share: California is hands-down the biggest market in America for ZEVs right now (and there is still plenty of room for it to grow). No other state comes close. So if these numbers were higher, then 2030 US numbers would also probably be quite a bit higher. This is similar to the US ZEV Sales Share in 2026 question though because there are other things that are responsible for this, so it is not so much California sales, but rather other variables that are causing higher California sales in 2025 as well as higher US sales in 2030.</p>\n<p>Fuel economy regulations: This has the potential to be a big deal, but the difference between the 25th and 75th percentiles is quite small, and thus there would probably not be a huge difference between these two different scenarios.</p>\n<p>EV industry employment: I don't see 2025 EV industry employment playing a causal role in 2030 ZEV sales. If there is higher EV industry employment, it is because there is higher demand for ZEVs. I don't see how EV industry employment in 2025 could have a direct effect on 2030 ZEV market share. It seems like those people would only be employed because the demand was already there from some other causal factor.</p>\n<p>CO2 emissions in the US: I could see high CO2 emissions in 2025 leading the US government to enact stricter policies that in turn cause higher demand for ZEVs. These policies would probably only happen if a Democrat were president though, and it's hard to know whether these updated policies would show much of an effect in ZEV market share by 2030. On another note, there might also be some American citizens who decide to buy ZEVs because they are more concerned about the high CO2 emissions having a big impact on global warming, and they feel a greater urgency to help reduce emissions.</p>","comment_text":"I will use this likert chart as a reference for my forecasts:\n\nValue|Meaning\n|\n10|extremely negative impact\n20|very negative impact\n30|fairly negative impact\n40|slight negative impact\n50|no causal impact\n60|slight positive impact\n70|fairly positive impact\n80|very positive impact\n90|extremely positive impact\n\nHere are my values:\n\nVariable|Causal Rating\n|\nEV median range under $40k| 65\nPublic charging stations\t| 65\nUS ZEV sales share [2026]*\t| 60\nElectricity price\t| 45\nZEV tax credits claimed\t| 50\nGlobal ZEV sales share\t| 60\nStates adopting ZEV mandates\t| 60\nZEV federal fleet procurements\t| 50\nGasoline price\t| 75\nChange in energy transition metal index\t| 25\nZEV models in US under $40k\t| 55\nCalifornia ZEV sales share\t| 55\nFuel economy regulations\t| 55\nEV industry employment\t| 50\nCO2 emissions in the US| 55\n\nI'll go over each one:\n\nEV median range under $40k: I figure median range could have a big effect on how quickly ZEV adoption takes hold in America.

<p class="ng-scope"><strong><em>[Pro Forecasting] How causally impactful would the listed indicator be depending on 25th or 75th percentile resolution?</em></strong></p>
<p class="ng-scope">Please rate the following indicators on a scale of 1 to 99 following the criteria below, assessing how <em>causally impactful</em> the indicator is on causing a change in the US light-duty ZEV market share <strong>in 2030</strong> if the indicator were to resolve <strong>in 2025</strong> at the community’s 75th percentile forecast, as opposed to resolving at the community’s 25th percentile forecast:</p>
<ul class="ng-scope">
<li>A rating of 1 indicates that the indicator resolving at the 75th percentile value instead of the 25th percentile value in 2025 would have a massive and extremely important <strong>negative</strong> impact on light-duty ZEV market share in 2030. In other words, the ZEV market share would be <strong>lower</strong> than you otherwise forecasted if this were to occur, and you believe this indicator is the single most causally important factor affecting ZEV market share in 2030 by far.</li>
<li>A rating of 50 indicates that the indicator resolving at the 75th percentile value instead of the 25th percentile value in 2025 would <strong>neither positively or negatively</strong> impact ZEV market share in 2030. In other words, the ZEV market share would be unlikely to change from what you otherwise forecasted if this were to occur, and you believe this indicator is <strong>not at all</strong> a causally important factor affecting ZEV market share in 2030.</li>
<li>A rating of 99 indicates that the indicator resolving at the 75th percentile value instead of the 25th percentile value in 2025 would have a massive and extremely important <strong>positive</strong> impact on light-duty ZEV market share in 2030. In other words, the ZEV market share would be much <strong>higher</strong> than you otherwise forecasted if this were to occur, and you believe this indicator is the single most causally important factor affecting ZEV market share in 2030 by far.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ng-scope">Note that we are concerned with the impact of the indicator resolving at the 75th percentile as opposed to the 25th percentile. We are interested in learning your perceived <em>causal impact</em> of the range of outcomes associated with the interquartile range, so when assessing the causal impact please consider the world where the indicator resolves at the 75th percentile in comparison to the world where it resolves at the 25th percentile.</p>
<p class="ng-scope">We are defining <em>causal impact</em> to mean the impact that can be directly attributed to this indicator alone. For example, if one indicator is likely to be heavily influenced by another listed or unlisted indicator but also will be influential on US light-duty ZEV market share, it should not be rated as if it were <em>causally impactful</em> and instead the indicator that is the underlying influence should be rated higher.</p>
<p class="ng-scope">Please describe your ratings in the comments, and also note any confounding or reverse causality issues you believe to be at play.</p></div>

<p>Deficits and penalties. </p>
<p>ACC and ACC II are generally similar in their enforcement
mechanisms. Automakers may accrue and maintain a ZEV credit or deficit for a
particular model year for up to 3 years. If the automaker is not able to recover the
deficit by the fourth year, they are subject to a civil penalty. Through MY 2025 (ACC),
the penalty is $5,000 per ZEV credit. Through 2021, no automaker has had to pay a
penalty. For MYs 2026–2035, the penalty is $20,000 per ZEV value.</p>

Unintentional reductions in resource flows could be the result of civil or interstate conflicts; or could be the unintended result of government policy, like nationalisations, expropriations, and unexpected and significant increases in mining royalties, which discourage foreign investment.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/bolivia-vies-to-join-lithium-producers-club-after-years-of-disappointment-71065165" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bolivia is an example</a> of a country where I think government policy has already unintentionally significantly diminished the potential for resource production. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexicos-lopez-obrador-orders-ministry-step-up-lithium-nationalization-2023-02-19/?taid=63f197c29ed925000121f6c1&amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;utm_source=twitter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mexico is currently in the process</a> of nationalising lithium, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/15/chiles-constitutional-assembly-rejects-plans-to-nationalise-parts-of-mining-sector" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Chile nearly nationalised the industry last year.</a> As the value of these resources grows, I think there is a high risk of government policy focusing on potential short-term political benefits from nationalisations and increases in taxes at the risk of harming industry over the longer term.</p>
<p>Intentional reductions in resource flows could be the result of political tension with the US or the mining industry; or a result of other major consuming countries (for example, China) securing supply exclusivity in exchange for some significant benefit, like security guarantees, substantial development assistance, debt relief, etc. I think this is a greater risk in some of the less-developed producer countries. </p>
<p>In the US context, I think it would be politically controversial to openly tie something like development assistance or a security guarantee to assurances from the governments of major resource producing countries that they would not nationalise the mining industry or impose high mining royalties; this would probably be seen on the left as a form of neo-colonial/imperial hegemony, so it would probably be tricky to pull off. Conversely, in less democratic countries, it seems like this kind of quid pro quo would be more feasible. </p>
<p>One particular thing that it would probably be desirable to avoid is the formation of an OPEC-like cartel of critical minerals producers. If production is coordinated among the major producers, I worry that prices may settle on a level that is high enough that high-performance EVs remain a premium option out of the reach of many consumers.</p></div><!-- end ngIf: comment.comment_html && !isEditing --> <!-- ngIf: !isEditing --><edit-comment-text ng-if="!isEditing" edits="comment.edits" class="ng-scope ng-isolate-scope"><div class="EditedCommentText">edited by Pro A on Feb 22, 2023, 12:50 PM</div></edit-comment-text><!-- end ngIf: !isEditing --> </div><!-- end ngIf: !isHidden() --> <!-- ngIf: isEditing --> <!-- ngIf: !showQTitle || canEdit --><div class="comment__icon-bar-wrapper ng-scope" ng-if="!showQTitle || canEdit"> <div class="comment__icon-bar"> <div> <span class="small-margin metac-voter"> <svg width="32" height="32" viewBox="-16 -16 32 32" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" icon-name="voteUp" class="action-icon ng-isolate-scope hasvoted" ng-class="{hasvoted: comment.user_like==1, disabled: user.id==comment.author}" ng-click="likeComment(1)"> <rect class="icon-bg-rect" x="-16" y="-16" width="32" height="32" rx="4" ry="4"></rect> <path d="M-5,2.5l5,-5l5,5" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-linecap="round"></path> </svg> <!-- ngIf: comment.num_likes --><span ng-if="comment.num_likes" ng-class="{&#39;font-bold&#39;: comment.user_like}" class="ng-binding ng-scope font-bold">3</span><!-- end ngIf: comment.num_likes --> <!-- ngIf: !comment.news_item && user.level>=2 --><svg width="32" height="32" viewBox="-16 -16 32 32" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" icon-name="voteDown" class="action-icon ng-scope ng-isolate-scope" ng-if="!comment.news_item &amp;&amp;

<p>Change in Energy Transition Metal Index, rating: 20</p>
<p>I think this is the single most important indicator we have considered, in that a large increase in raw materials costs, particularly if it is sustained over a long period of time, could seriously imperil the affordability of the kind of high-performance ZEVs that US consumers desire. If a ZEV with the performance characteristics that US consumers consider acceptable retains a large subsidy-adjusted purchase price premium relative to a comparable ICE vehicle, I expect that to have a very significant negative impact on ZEV purchases, as less affluent consumers will be hard-pressed to make the transition even if they are eager to do so. A minor increase in the cost of raw materials, on the order of 8%, would probably be offset by battery technology improvements such that it would not significantly affect affordability; but larger increases, on the order of 70%, would probably mean ZEV purchase prices are still substantially higher than those of ICE vehicles. </p>
<p>Public charging stations, rating: 77.5</p>
<p>I think this is the second most important indicator among those we have considered, and I assign it relatively high causal significance because I think that if the number of charging stations in existence in the near term is towards the higher end of our expectations, it means that certain barriers (like permitting, or protectionist sourcing requirements) to construction have probably been somewhat remediated; or that they were less of an impediment than had been expected. If these potential problems have been addressed or overcome rapidly, the charging availability anxiety problem likely becomes a less significant impediment to ZEV purchases on a shorter timescale. I think that anxiety is one of the bigger issues that need to be overcome in order for consumers to be confident that a ZEV can meet their needs, so I think this is a particularly important indicator.</p>
<p>EV median range under $40k, rating: 70</p>
<p>Approximately <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-24/americans-have-always-bought-too-much-car-now-they-re-doing-it-with-evs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">300 miles of range per charge seems to be a significant tipping point</a> for American consumers. If relatively affordable mass-market EVs have achieved a median range well in excess of that as early as 2025, the range anxiety problem should be largely overcome, which I would expect to have a significant positive effect on EV sales. I would rate this as more significant if the 25th percentile value were significantly further from that 300 mile target, but 272 isn't too far off, so I consider this indicator a bit less significant than charging availability, given the larger difference between the 25th and 75th percentiles there.</p>
<p>Gasoline price, rating: 70</p>
<p>I rate this as a highly significant indicator on the basis that I expect uncomfortably high gas prices, especially if sustained, and if consumers <em>expect</em> them to be sustained, to be a major factor that causes consumers to consider purchasing ZEVs - but I don't rate it as more significant than those mentioned above because I think the anxieties that consumers have about suitability (range, charging availability) and purchase affordability are significant enough that even if gas prices are uncomfortably high, they would be (if not addressed) significant barriers to ZEV purchase.</p>
<p><strong>Indicators of moderate significance</strong></p>
<p>US ZEV sales share (2026), rating: 65</p>
<p>I consider this moderately important in that it indicates higher enthusiasm than expected for ZEV purchases; however, I don't assign it a higher rating because I think this indicator is downstream of those mentioned above. A higher ZEV sales share is the result of success elsewhere; such as maintaining low and stable raw materials prices, building charging infrastructure, and improving ZEV technology to meet consumers' needs and wants.   </p>
<p>ZEV tax credits claimed, rating: 60</p>
<p>My reasoning here is much the same as mentioned above for the US ZEV sales share.</p>
<p>Global ZEV sales share, rating: 60</p>
<p>My reasoning here is much the same as mentioned above for the US ZEV sales share.</p>
<p>States adopting ZEV mandates, rating: 60</p>
<p>I consider this a moderately important indicator because I think it's likely that states that adopt ZEV mandates are likely to be states that would have had a relatively faster transition to ZEVs even in the absence of any mandates; however, they would still probably accelerate the transition. A significant matter of uncertainty here is how stable these mandates would be; the fact that they are in place in 2025 would not necessarily mean that they will remain in force unaltered through 2030. Uncertainty around regulatory stability causes me not to rate this as more significant. Another factor is that the extent to which it is politically feasible to enact a ZEV mandate is itself a result of other outcomes, like ZEV affordability, consumer satisfaction with ZEVs on the market, and consumer confidence in available charging infrastructure. As I think states likely need those to be trending in the right direction if they are to enact ZEV mandates, I think the existence of the mandates themselves is more a result of other factors than a major causal factor in itself.</p>
<p>ZEV models in US under $40k, rating: 60</p>
<p>I consider this a moderately important indicator because greater consumer choice in the ZEV marketplace would generally be expected to have a positive effect on the ZEV sales share; however, I don't rate this as more significant because there is significant uncertainty around the performance characteristics of vehicles in this segment of the market. If a significant fraction of vehicles in this segment have performance characteristics that do not satisfy many consumers, a large number of low-selling models may not have a particularly significant effect on the ZEV sales share. To the extent that it may be the case that there are many models of high-selling ZEVs under $40k, I think that would mainly be the result of success in achieving a stable supply of reasonably priced raw materials, so I do not rate this indicator as highly significant, as it is largely the result of successful policy elsewhere. </p>
<p><strong>Indicators of least significance</strong></p>
<p>California ZEV sales share, rating: 55</p>
<p>I rate this as one of the less significant indicators because I think the Californian economy, consumer, and regulatory environment are unrepresentative of the US in general, and likely to remain that way for the foreseeable future. However, California is one of the larger vehicle marketplaces in the US, and as such I think a higher ZEV sales share earlier in California could still be indicative of a faster than expected transition nationally. However, I think that would be the result of other indicators, like the charging infrastructure buildout pace, affordability of raw materials, gas prices, et cetera, so I assign this indicator relatively low causal significance in its own right.</p>
<p>EV industry employment, rating: 55</p>
<p>I rate this as one of the less significant indicators primarily because I think it is a result of success elsewhere; however, I think it does potentially have some causal significance of its own in that federal politicians may be more likely to advocate and vote for ZEV-friendly measures if they have a significant number of workers in their districts who would benefit from them, and if companies employing these workers are lobbying for such measures. </p>
<p>CO2 emissions in the US, rating: 55</p>
<p>I rate this as one of the less significant indicators because while I do think it is true that a non-trivial fraction of consumers purchase ZEVs because of environmental concerns, I think they comprise a relatively small proportion of the marketplace, and are likely to be early adopters. In general, I think the vast majority of consumers are much more concerned with factors like affordability and performance than emissions. However, if emissions are somewhat higher than expected, this group of consumers highly concerned about emissions may become larger. The political situation is relatively unclear, in that if emissions are higher than expected, it seems likely to have been a result of policy failures or changes in policy that have de-emphasized or diminished the ZEV transition. I am not particularly confident about this one, and may revise to a slightly negative impact, or no impact. </p>
<p>Electricity price, rating: 47.5</p>
<p>I consider this one of the least significant indicators because the difference between the two values is very small. I think it would have a very minor negative effect on ZEV sales. </p>
<p>Fuel economy regulations, rating: 52.5</p>
<p>I consider this one of the least significant indicators because the difference between the two values is quite small. I think it would have a very minor positive effect on ZEV sales.</p>
<p>ZEV federal fleet procurements, rating: 51</p>
<p>I consider this the least significant indicator because federal fleet purchases are a very small proportion of US vehicle purchases, and a greater ZEV share of the federal fleet seems unlikely to lead to either a significant change in consumer purchasing behaviour or changes in government policy that accelerate ZEV adoption. I rate it as very slightly positive because I think greater exposure to ZEVs among government workers may increase the probability of those workers purchasing ZEVs for themselves, or advocating for their use. </p>

<p>EV median range under $40k: While the difference between 25th and 75th percentile is quite high, I think the 25th percentile forecast should already be enough to allay a majority of distance anxiety concerns. As such, while I think this metric contributes to the outcome variable positively, it does so moderately.</p>
<p>Public charging stations: The move from 85k to 165k is equivalent to almost doubling the charging stations. Even though I think that (low numbers of) charging stations by themselves are not a major inhibitor, a large surplus of them is likely to positively affect the outcome.</p>
<p>US ZEV sales share: I have trouble disambiguating correlation and causality here. Clearly, an increase of 8 percentage points in sales share is massive and will determine later numbers, I do not think that, controlling for the other factors, that this has a causal effect (like a social proof/peer effect that could be applicable here), though there is some uncertainty here on my part.</p>
<p>Electricity price: As the 25th and 75th percentiles are very close, and because I do not think that the outcome variable is sensitive to small changes like that, I do not think this has a substantial causal impact on the outcome.</p>
<p>ZEV tax credits claimed: I think that the majority of causal impact of this variable is captured by ‘ZEV tax credits available’, making the claimed tax credits largely irrelevant causally. </p>
<p>Global ZEV sales share: An increase of over 10 percentage points in global EV sales is quite likely to have a causal impact on the outcome variable unless protectionist measures are introduced or expanded</p>
<p>States adopting ZEV mandates: In my view, a difference of almost 7 whole states can make a massive causal impact, directly influencing the outcome variable and other variables here, thus representing a substantive causal factor.</p>
<p>ZEV federal flee procurements: I do not think that this variable contributes causally to the outcome at all, and any small effect that it may have is probably subsumed by other factors.</p>
<p>Gasoline price: Because of the big distance between the 25th and the 75th percentile, and because this difference is very likely to be reflected in economic choices like the outcome variable, I see gasoline prices differences of this magnitude as a driver of ZEV adoption.</p>
<p>Change in energy transition metal index: As before, due to the large distance (almost 60 percentage points) between the two percentiles, I see the price of raw materials as a significant (negative) driver of the outcome variable, though I do anticipate substitution and alternative solutions (though not necessarily in this timeframe).</p>
<p>ZEV models under $40k: I struggle to see how this metric meaningfully impacts adoption at the margins presented here, as a certain amount of cheaper models should probably be sufficient to satisfy demand at this price level. Even doubling the number of models available (without offering new features at this price point) may not contribute significantly.</p>
<p>California ZEV sales share: California’s ZEV sale share definitely plays a large part in the total US market due to its size, but I am unsure about its causal impact above and beyond its representation in the market.</p>
<p>Fuel economy regulations: While a metric like this would in general have the potential to direct consumer behaviour quite strongly, the small differences between the 25th and 75th percentiles make this metric less causally impactful than it otherwise would have been.</p>
<p>EV industry employment: I think that EV industry employment has high correlation with the outcome variable, but its causal force is pretty much fully absorbed by other factors, making this a causally ineffectual variable.</p>
<p>CO2 emissions in the US: A difference of over half a billion tons may spur other policy changes that then drive the outcome variable, which is why I think that this factor itself does not strongly contribute to the outcome, but still has an above-neutral causal efficacy rating.</p></div><!-- end ngIf: comment.comment_html && !isEditing --> <!-- ngIf: !isEditing --><edit-comment-text ng-if="!isEditing" edits="comment.edits" class="ng-scope ng-isolate-scope"><div class="EditedCommentText">edited by Pro E on Feb 22, 2023, 9:20 AM</div></edit-comment-text><!-- end ngIf: !isEditing --> </div><!-- end ngIf: !isHidden() --> <!-- ngIf: isEditing --> <!-- ngIf: !showQTitle || canEdit --><div class="comment__icon-bar-wrapper ng-scope" ng-if="!showQTitle || canEdit"> <div class="comment__icon-bar"> <div> <span class="small-margin metac-voter"> <svg width="32" height="32" viewBox="-16 -16 32 32" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" icon-name="voteUp" class="action-icon ng-isolate-scope" ng-class="{hasvoted: comment.user_like==1, disabled: user.id==comment.author}" ng-click="likeComment(1)"> <rect class="icon-bg-rect" x="-16" y="-16" width="32" height="32" rx="4" ry="4"></rect> <path d="M-5,2.5l5,-5l5,5" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-linecap="round"></path> </svg> <!-- ngIf: comment.num_likes --><span ng-if="comment.num_likes" ng-class="{&#39;font-bold&#39;: comment.user_like}" class="ng-binding ng-scope">2</span><!-- end ngIf: comment.num_likes --> <!-- ngIf: !comment.news_item && user.level>=2 --><svg width="32" height="32" viewBox="-16 -16 32 32" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" icon-name="voteDown" class="action-icon ng-scope ng-isolate-scope" ng-if="!comment.news_item &amp;&amp;

!isEditing" bind-html-math="get_html()"><p>Here is my <a href="https://i.imgur.com/FpFhzH3.png" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">simple causal diagram</a>. My numerical estimates of the indicator impacts (based roughly on the Likert scale methodology suggested by <a href="https://www.metaculus.com/accounts/" rel="nofollow">@Pro D</a>) are in a table below.</p>
<p>Here's my quick take on each indicator:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>EV Range:</strong> Range is certainly one of the most talked about aspects around EVs and I expect it will substantially impact the rate of their adoption. With an 80 mile difference between 25th and 75th percentiles, I'm rating this as one of the more important indicators, though the biggest difference will likely be for long-haul travel with medium-to-heavy-duty vehicles.</li>
<li><strong>Charging Stations:</strong> A roughly 2x difference in public charging stations seems like it would be impactful, though again this would be more relevant for long-haul travel and dependent on how good EV ranges are. If most day-to-day charging is done privately at homes or workplaces, that might slightly lessen the need for these around major cities at least, though not by very much due to e.g. tourists and business travelers.</li>
<li><strong>US ZEV Sales [2026]:</strong> Seeing as ZEV adoption will follow an S-curve and likely still be before or not far above the inflection point (50% adoption), how the exponential shapes up within the next 3 years seems quite important.</li>
<li><strong>Electricity Price:</strong> The difference between 11 and 12 cents/kWh is pretty small, so the importance is mostly negligible here.</li>
<li><strong>ZEV Tax Credits:</strong> While maybe not perfectly so, the 75th and 25th percentiles here seem to essentially split the possibilities between something like <em>"Democrats in power; tax credits largely in place or expanded"</em> and <em>"Republicans in power; tax credits largely cut or abolished"</em>. Ranking just the tax credits by themselves however, I don't expect their impact to be particularly large.</li>
<li><strong>Global ZEV Sales:</strong> A little less impactful than US-specific sales, but certainly creates pressure for US adoption to not slack as much if other countries are doing well. Economies of scale matter for lowering costs, as <a href="https://www.metaculus.com/accounts/" rel="nofollow">@Pro D</a> mentioned.</li>
<li><strong>ZEV Mandates:</strong> Pretty direct cause-and-effect here for ZEV sales, though the absence of mandates in states that were seriously considering them in the first place doesn't mean their actual EV adoption will slow down all that much anyway.</li>
<li><strong>ZEV Federal Fleet:</strong> Taking just the indicator itself into account, without the underlying implications for e.g. which party is in charge (see ZEV Tax Credits), this seems... basically irrelevant?</li>
<li><strong>Gasoline Price:</strong> <em>"While consumers appear to be influenced by both gasoline and electricity prices when making adoption decisions, the influence of gasoline prices is roughly four to six times stronger, relative to operating costs, than is the electricity price."</em> <a href="https://www.ucits.org/research-project/2020-12/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.ucits.org/research-project/2020-12/</a></li>
<li><strong>Metal Prices:</strong> With a 60% difference in raw materials costs, this would obviously have a substantial impact on overall ZEV production costs in 2030. If I had to pick two of the most impactful indicators overall (from the ones given), it would be this and gas prices.</li>
<li><strong>ZEV Models:</strong> Having a nearly 2x wider range of affordable EV models to choose from ought to help if it results in increased healthy competition between car companies, though I'm admittedly uncertain on how big of an impact going from 15 to 27 models makes (as opposed to say, 5 to 10 models).</li>
<li><strong>California ZEV Sales:</strong> I think this is only impactful in the sense that California is the biggest EV market within the US, not that high percentages of EV adoptions in CA strongly motivate many other states to follow suit. To whatever extent they do, that's mostly covered by the ZEV Mandates indicator.</li>
<li><strong>Fuel Economy Regulations:</strong> The difference between the percentiles is again pretty small, so I'm rating the impact as very minimally positive.</li>
<li><strong>EV Employment:</strong> This seems like it would be more driven <em>by</em> increasing EV adoption, not the other way around. Though I could see there being a minor positive feedback loop happening here in the second half of this decade, i.e. more employment in the EV sector slightly increasing the rate of adoption in later years.</li>
<li><strong>CO2 Emissions:</strong> Again, this would probably be affected more <em>by</em> increasing EVs and not vice versa. While a lot of people would buy an EV with something like "climate-friendliness" being one of their major reasons for doing so, I don't actually see US CO2 emissions specifically being the thing that swings a lot of customers over. Government might care more, but I don't see them acting drastically differently with a ~10% counterfactual difference in emissions.</li>

<p>I'll go over each one:</p>
<p>EV median range under $40k: I figure median range could have a big effect on how quickly ZEV adoption takes hold in America. That said, median range will probably be most important for non-light ZEVs such as trucks where they are frequently driving long distances.</p>
<p>Public charging stations: I figure that the amount of charging stations will play an important role in ZEV sales, but it's hard for me to know how much of an effect 165k vs. 85k charging stations would play because I am unsure what number of charging stations will be enough where it is no longer a pain to find a charging station if you have a ZEV.</p>
<p>US ZEV sales share [2026]*: This would have a huge effect on my forecast for 2030 sales because it is signaling how quickly ZEV adoption is taking place, but I am not giving it a higher number because I think there are other causal factors that are creating 2026 sales and 2030 sales to be a certain way, so the direct causality from the 2026 sales share is perhaps more humble.</p>
<p>Electricity price: This would have a much bigger effect if there was a large enough difference between the 25th and 75th percentile, but the difference between them is miniscule.</p>
<p>ZEV tax credits claimed: It's hard to know how this will affect sales because more tax credits claimed might mean the government is closer to winding down this tax credit program because it feels like the program has already done what it was meant to do, or it could also mean that the government wants to continue this tax credit program because it believes the program is a success. I'm not sure which thing will have a stronger effect, so I'm staying neutral for now with this one.</p>
<p>Global ZEV sales share: If global ZEV sales are quite a bit higher, that could create downward pressure on prices as car companies are able to lower costs as a result of economies of scale.</p>
<p>States adopting ZEV mandates: This could have a huge impact if the difference between the 25th and 75th percentile was bigger, but the group of states that would potentially qualify as the 16 states adopting this mandate will probably have large uptake regardless of whether there are mandates in place.</p>
<p>ZEV federal fleet procurements: I don't see there being much causality because there could be different parties in power in the two years we are looking at (2025 and 2030), so the one party could easily do exactly the opposite of what the other one did (unless cost savings were so significant that Republicans were much more open to having ZEVs for federal vehicles, but this would be caused by another variable: cheaper prices, so there is still not much causality between ZEV federal fleet procurement in 2025 and ZEV market share in 2030).</p>
<p>Gasoline price: I think this is one of the main inputs for how high ZEV market share will be in 2030. The price difference between the 25th and 75th percentile is big enough that I think there would be a fairly large impact in the difference between these two scenarios.</p>
<p>Change in energy transition metal index: This is also another input that I think will have a big effect, especially considering there is a large difference between the 25th and 75th percentiles. If ZEVs are much more expensive, there will be significantly less adoption.</p>
<p>ZEV models in US under $40k: I'm not sure how much 27 models cheaper than 40k vs. 15 models cheaper than 40k would make a difference. As long as there are enough models (15 seems plenty) where consumers feel they have enough of a choice to find one that is right for them, this doesn't seem like it should have a huge effect.</p>
<p>California ZEV sales share: California is hands-down the biggest market in America for ZEVs right now (and there is still plenty of room for it to grow). No other state comes close. So if these numbers were higher, then 2030 US numbers would also probably be quite a bit higher. This is similar to the US ZEV Sales Share in 2026 question though because there are other things that are responsible for this, so it is not so much California sales, but rather other variables that are causing higher California sales in 2025 as well as higher US sales in 2030.</p>
<p>Fuel economy regulations: This has the potential to be a big deal, but the difference between the 25th and 75th percentiles is quite small, and thus there would probably not be a huge difference between these two different scenarios.</p>
<p>EV industry employment: I don't see 2025 EV industry employment playing a causal role in 2030 ZEV sales. If there is higher EV industry employment, it is because there is higher demand for ZEVs. I don't see how EV industry employment in 2025 could have a direct effect on 2030 ZEV market share. It seems like those people would only be employed because the demand was already there from some other causal factor.</p>
<p>CO2 emissions in the US: I could see high CO2 emissions in 2025 leading the US government to enact stricter policies that in turn cause higher demand for ZEVs. These policies would probably only happen if a Democrat were president though, and it's hard to know whether these updated policies would show much of an effect in ZEV market share by 2030. On another note, there might also be some American citizens who decide to buy ZEVs because they are more concerned about the high CO2 emissions having a big impact on global warming, and they feel a greater urgency to help reduce emissions.</p></div><!-- end ngIf: comment.comment_html && !isEditing --> <!-- ngIf: !isEditing --><edit-comment-text ng-if="!isEditing" edits="comment.edits" class="ng-scope ng-isolate-scope"></edit-comment-text><!-- end ngIf: !isEditing --> </div><!-- end ngIf: !isHidden() --> <!-- ngIf: isEditing --> <!-- ngIf: !showQTitle || canEdit --><div class="comment__icon-bar-wrapper ng-scope" ng-if="!showQTitle || canEdit"> <div class="comment__icon-bar"> <div> <span class="small-margin metac-voter"> <svg width="32" height="32" viewBox="-16 -16 32 32" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" icon-name="voteUp" class="action-icon ng-isolate-scope" ng-class="{hasvoted: comment.user_like==1, disabled: user.id==comment.author}" ng-click="likeComment(1)"> <rect class="icon-bg-rect" x="-16" y="-16" width="32" height="32" rx="4" ry="4"></rect> <path d="M-5,2.5l5,-5l5,5" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-linecap="round"></path> </svg> <!-- ngIf: comment.num_likes --><span ng-if="comment.num_likes" ng-class="{&#39;font-bold&#39;: comment.user_like}" class="ng-binding ng-scope">3</span><!-- end ngIf: comment.num_likes --> <!-- ngIf: !comment.news_item && user.level>=2 --><svg width="32" height="32" viewBox="-16 -16 32 32" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" icon-name="voteDown" class="action-icon ng-scope ng-isolate-scope" ng-if="!comment.news_item &amp;&amp;

Please read the text carefully, because this is not like a typical forecast. This will not be scored, and is only used for determining your ratings. Please describing your ratings and the reasons for them in comments, and especially noting any confounding or reverse causality you think might be at play. Describing a full list of all your ratings in comments is not necessary if you wish to just highlight some of the most important ones (though a full list is more than welcome if you're willing to share it). We'll use this in conjunction with causal diagrams as described in previous emails, and sharing links to images of your causal diagrams to support your ratings is encouraged!</p>
<p>We know this is something new and experimental, so we're interested in hearing your feedback! Is what we want you to do clear? Was this difficult to think about? Is there anything confusing or anything about this format that you think doesn't work well? Please provide feedback you may have and any other meta level thoughts as a reply to this comment!</p>
<p>Lastly, we've tentatively selected the year 2025 to condition on, with the target year of 2030. Are there any of these indicators which you would consider to be causally impactful, but based on what happens in a different year instead of 2025? If so let me know as we can add other indicator timeframes here, and we'll also be using your comments to qualitatively assess the importance of these indicators so you're encouraged to mention any timing issues in your comments.</p></div><!-- end ngIf: comment.comment_html && !isEditing --> <!-- ngIf: !isEditing --><edit-comment-text ng-if="!isEditing" edits="comment.edits" class="ng-scope ng-isolate-scope"><div class="EditedCommentText">edited by RyanBeck on Feb 20, 2023, 3:26 PM</div></edit-comment-text><!-- end ngIf: !isEditing --> </div><!-- end ngIf: !isHidden() --> <!-- ngIf: isEditing --> <!-- ngIf: !showQTitle || canEdit --><div class="comment__icon-bar-wrapper ng-scope" ng-if="!showQTitle || canEdit"> <div class="comment__icon-bar"> <div> <span class="small-margin metac-voter"> <svg width="32" height="32" viewBox="-16 -16 32 32" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" icon-name="voteUp" class="action-icon ng-isolate-scope disabled" ng-class="{hasvoted: comment.user_like==1, disabled: user.id==comment.author}" ng-click="likeComment(1)"> <rect class="icon-bg-rect" x="-16" y="-16" width="32" height="32" rx="4" ry="4"></rect> <path d="M-5,2.5l5,-5l5,5" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-linecap="round"></path> </svg> <!-- ngIf: comment.num_likes --><span ng-if="comment.num_likes" ng-class="{&#39;font-bold&#39;: comment.user_like}" class="ng-binding ng-scope">3</span><!-- end ngIf: comment.num_likes --> <!-- ngIf: !comment.news_item && user.level>=2 --><svg width="32" height="32" viewBox="-16 -16 32 32" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" icon-name="voteDown" class="action-icon ng-scope ng-isolate-scope disabled" ng-if="!comment.news_item &amp;&amp;

One point that I think is important to bring up though is how do we accurately use these numbers on the 1-99 scale though without there being a high level of subjectivity to the final crowd forecast? For example, my 85 might be equal to another person's 75.</p>
<p>Can we have some kind of likert scale instead, just so all the forecasters can be on the same page with what each number equals?</p>
<p>For example, something like:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>extremely negative impact</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>very negative impact</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>fairly negative impact</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>slight negative impact</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>No causal impact either way</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td>slight positive impact</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7</td>
<td>fairly positive impact</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8</td>
<td>very positive impact</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>9</td>
<td>extremely positive impact</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>If this is too much of a pain on Metaculus' end to update the numbers to a 1-9 scale, I am happy to keep things as they are, but maybe we could have some numbers with agreed upon meanings. If we were to stick to the 1-99 scale, we could perhaps do something like this:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>10</td>
<td>extremely negative impact</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>20</td>
<td>very negative impact</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>30</td>
<td>fairly negative impact</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>40</td>
<td>slight negative impact</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>50</td>
<td>No causal impact either way</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>60</td>
<td>slight positive impact</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>70</td>
<td>fairly positive impact</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>80</td>
<td>very positive impact</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>90</td>
<td>extremely positive impact</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
