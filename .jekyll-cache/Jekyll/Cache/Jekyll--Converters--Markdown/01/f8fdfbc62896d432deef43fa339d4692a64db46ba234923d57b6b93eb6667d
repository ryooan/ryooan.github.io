I"œ<p>This is some really cool stuff. A group called Open AI has used machine learning to teach a robotic hand to solve a Rubikâ€™s cube. They trained the hand to overcome a variety of interferences with its mechanics as well, such as having some of its fingers tied or having a stuffed giraffe try to move the cube around.</p>

<p>According to their article it can solve a Rubikâ€™s cube 60% of the time, and it can solve a Rubikâ€™s cube starting at the maximum number of moves from completion (26) 20% of the time. If it drops the cube or times out itâ€™s considered a failure. The movements arenâ€™t programmed in directly, they trained the hand using a simulated model of the hand so that they could do thousands and thousands of iterations under a variety of random environments (different cube sizes, parts of the hand disabled, different finger friction, etc.). Then they applied the resulting program to the actual mechanical hand.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s pretty amazing how much movement this hand has and how it adapts to the â€œperturbationsâ€ they apply. They can randomize a Rubikâ€™s cube and place it in the hand and itâ€™ll work out how to solve it. Check out their article about it for more information, itâ€™s really fascinating and I definitely recommend checking out the part about the perturbations, the videos of that are really cool: <a href="https://openai.com/blog/solving-rubiks-cube/">https://openai.com/blog/solving-rubiks-cube/</a></p>
